;NOTE: I use the right mouse button for this because my current mouse does not have macro keys on it. Since you guys make gaming content as well, I assume you use gaming mice,
;which naturally don't give us many mouse buttons to edit with. I could use the middle mouse button, but it requires too much pressure to push down so often, and you 
;have to be careful not to accidentally scroll it. But if you want to use a button other than the right mouse button, the script becomes a lot simpler. 
;Scroll down to the bottom for that script.

;That is color 0x212121, and last I checked, it shows up in many other places in premiere, not just that part of the timeline.
;The easy solution is to just fill up your timeline with tracks; have no blank space.

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;First, we define all the timeline's DEFAULT possible colors.
;(Note that your colors will be different if you changed the UI brightness inside preferences > appearance > brightness.)
;I used Window Spy (it comes with AHK) to detect the exact colors onscreen.
timeline1 = 0x414141 ;timeline color inside the in/out points ON a targeted track
timeline2 = 0x313131 ;timeline color of the separating LINES between targeted AND non targeted tracks inside the in/out points
timeline3 = 0x1b1b1b ;the timeline color inside in/out points on a NON targeted track
timeline4 = 0x202020 ;the color of the bare timeline NOT inside the in out points
timeline5 = 0xDFDFDF ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, NOT in the in/out points
timeline6 = 0xE4E4E4 ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on a TARGETED track
timeline7 = 0xBEBEBE ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on an UNTARGETED track

;If you don't want to use Rbutton (the right mouse button), then you don't need to check for colors and things. This simplifies the script siginificantly.
;In the following script, You can change "Mbutton" to anything else. like "Xbutton1", or  even "F12" if you wanted.
;So, assuming you've mapped "move playhead to cursor" to the \ key, the problem is that it fires once, waits 1 second, and only then does it continue to fire.

;These next two lines are very important. You have to change the "menu mask key" away from being CTRL, to something that won't result in cross-talk. Read this thread to learn the details: https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=76&t=57683

;Note that the script will add a little red ðŸš« to your taskbar, which can be right clicked to be disabled or exited from the menu.

; You can hold down both ALT keys whenever you want to easily toggle this script on and off. This is useful for things like Premiere's keyboard shortcuts menu, which has ALT-nullification of its own.



;TO AUTO-START THIS SCRIPT WHEN WINDOWS STARTS:

; Once you've chosen a good folder location for the script, right click on it and choose "create shortcut." Then drag that shortcut into your startup folder! KEEP IN MIND that there are TWO startup folders - one for your user account, and one for ALL users. you can use either one. Here they are:

; THE SOLUTION IS LITERALLY JUST TWO LINES:


; ~LAlt::Sendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}
; ~RAlt::Sendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}

;;; I had no idea that {Blind} was a thing in AHK. Super helpful. 


;;;UPDATE: Those two lines totally work, but I am now trying a slightly different thing instead:

~LAlt::
Sendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}
KeyWait, LAlt ; 
Sendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}
return

~RAlt::
Sendinput {Blind}{sc0E9}
KeyWait, RAlt ; so that it doesn't keep spamming SC0E9
Sendinput {Blind}{sc0EA}
return
/*

~LAlt::
sendinput, {SC0E9 down} ;this is the scan code of an unassigned key. As long as you nor the system never use it for anything else, it can be used in THIS way to cancel the menu acceleration.
KeyWait, LAlt
return

~LAlt up::
sendinput, {SC0E9 up}
return

~RAlt::
;sendinput, {RAlt down}
sendinput, {SC0E9 down}
;;tooltip, Ralt is pressed
KeyWait, RAlt
;;tooltip, Ralt was released
return

~RAlt up::
;sendinput, {RAlt up}
sendinput, {SC0E9 up}
;;tooltip, 
return

*/

;;;;;;;alternatively, it might be as just 2 lines:

Lalt & Ralt::suspend ;hit both ALT keys simultaneously to toggle the functonality of this script. The tray icon will also change visually, so you will always know. You might want to delete this line if it's messing you up!



;;comment in the code below if you wish to reassign alt modifier combinations:



;!f::msgbox,,,To block modifier key use of alt you can do it like this,0.7
;!e::msgbox,,,replace msgbox with whatever code you want,0.7
;!w::msgbox,,,horray for having control of your own computer,0.7

;;biggest differeence is that the firs tone has an escape down event still inside the F18 events. idk why.
